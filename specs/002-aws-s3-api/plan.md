   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md ✓
   → Research completed with all technology decisions
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md ✓
   → All design artifacts generated successfully
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section ✓
   → No new violations detected, design maintains simplicity

## Summary
Build a Python CLI tool named "s3tester" that validates S3 API compatibility by executing YAML-defined test scenarios against S3-compatible storage systems. The tool will use boto3 for S3 operations, asyncio for parallel execution, pytest for testing framework, and jsonschema for configuration validation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: boto3 (AWS S3 client), asyncio (parallel processing), PyYAML (config parsing), jsonschema (config validation)  
**Storage**: N/A (testing tool, no persistent storage)  
**Testing**: pytest (unit and integration tests)  
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows CLI  
**Project Type**: single (CLI tool)  
**Performance Goals**: Handle 100+ concurrent S3 operations, process large files (1GB+)  
**Constraints**: Must support all major S3 operations, handle network failures gracefully  
**Scale/Scope**: 50+ S3 API operations, complex test scenarios with setup/teardown, credential management

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 1 (s3tester CLI tool)
- Using framework directly? Yes (boto3, asyncio, pytest directly - no wrappers)

- Libraries listed: 
  - s3tester.core (test execution engine)
  - s3tester.config (YAML parsing and validation)

- Library docs: llms.txt format planned

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes (contract tests first)
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (real S3 or MinIO for testing)
- Integration tests for: S3 operations, credential handling, config parsing
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes (JSON logs for test execution)
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A (CLI tool)
- Error context sufficient? Yes (detailed S3 error reporting)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.0 (initial)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A (initial version)

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (single project) - CLI tool with library architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

Research completed successfully. Key findings documented in `research.md`:

- **S3 API Client**: boto3 client interface with strategic session management
- **Async Processing**: ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound operations (3-7x better than aiobotocore)
- **Configuration**: PyYAML + Pydantic for safe parsing and validation
- **CLI Framework**: Click for feature-rich command interface
- **Error Handling**: Layered exceptions with exponential backoff
- **File Processing**: pathlib with context managers for file:// URLs
- **Testing**: pytest with moto for S3 mocking
- **Output**: Rich console + structured JSON/YAML export

**Output**: ✅ research.md complete with all technology decisions resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

Design phase completed successfully. Generated artifacts:

### Data Model (`data-model.md`)
- **Primary Entities**: TestConfiguration, GlobalConfig, CredentialSet, TestGroup, Operation, ExpectedResult, TestResult, TestSession
- **Validation Rules**: Comprehensive schema validation at multiple levels
- **State Transitions**: Clear state machine for test execution
- **Relationships**: Well-defined entity relationships and references

### API Contracts (`contracts/`)
- **CLI Contract** (`cli-contract.md`): Complete command structure, options, output formats, exit codes
- **Configuration Schema** (`config-schema.json`): JSON Schema for YAML validation with 50+ S3 operations

### User Documentation (`quickstart.md`)
- **Installation**: pip install instructions
- **Basic Usage**: Configuration creation, validation, test execution
- **Advanced Examples**: File uploads, permission testing, CI integration
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

### Development Context (`CLAUDE.md`)
- **Architecture Overview**: Technology stack and patterns
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Code patterns and best practices
- **Quality Standards**: Testing, error handling, performance guidelines

**Output**: ✅ All Phase 1 artifacts generated successfully

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load design artifacts from Phase 1 (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md)
- Generate contract tests for CLI interface and configuration schema
- Create model implementation tasks for each entity (TestConfiguration, CredentialSet, etc.)
- Generate operation wrapper tasks for 50+ S3 API operations
- Create integration test tasks for complete workflows
- Generate CLI command implementation tasks

**Task Categories with Dependencies**:
1. **Contract Tests** [P] - Can run in parallel, no implementation dependencies
   - CLI contract test (validate command structure, options, exit codes)
   - Configuration schema validation test
   - Output format validation tests (JSON, YAML, table)

2. **Data Model Implementation** [P] - Independent Pydantic models
   - TestConfiguration, GlobalConfig models
   - CredentialSet, TestGroup models  
   - Operation, ExpectedResult models
   - TestResult, TestSession models

3. **Core Library Components** - Sequential dependencies
   - Configuration parser with YAML + schema validation
   - S3 client factory with credential management
   - Operation executor with async ThreadPoolExecutor
   - Result validator comparing expected vs actual outcomes

4. **S3 Operation Wrappers** [P] - Can be implemented in parallel
   - Bucket operations (CreateBucket, DeleteBucket, ListBuckets, etc.)
   - Object operations (PutObject, GetObject, DeleteObject, etc.) 
   - Multipart upload operations
   - Tagging and lifecycle operations

5. **CLI Implementation** - Depends on core components
   - Click-based command structure
   - Configuration loading and validation
   - Test execution orchestration
   - Rich-based output formatting

6. **Integration Tests** - Depends on full implementation
   - End-to-end workflow tests with moto
   - Real S3 integration tests (optional, for CI)
   - Error handling and retry logic tests
   - Performance tests with concurrent operations

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD approach: Contract tests → Model tests → Integration tests → Unit tests
- Dependency order: Models → Core → Operations → CLI → Integration
- Parallel execution marked with [P] for independent implementation

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered tasks in dependency order

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation following TDD principles and constitutional requirements
**Phase 5**: Validation with quickstart.md execution and performance testing

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations detected - simple, direct architecture maintained*

No complexity deviations documented. The design maintains:
- Single project structure with library modules
- Direct framework usage (boto3, click, pydantic)
- Simple data model without unnecessary abstractions
- Real dependencies in tests (moto for S3 mocking)

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
