**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AWS S3 API Ìò∏ÌôòÏÑ± ÌÖåÏä§Ìä∏Î•º ÏúÑÌïú ÌÖåÏä§Ìä∏ ÎèÑÍµ¨Ïù∏ s3testerÎ•º Í∞úÎ∞úÌï†Í±∞Ïïº. ÏûêÏÑ∏Ìïú ÏÇ¨ÏñëÏùÄ specify.md Î•º Ï∞∏Í≥†Ìï¥Ï§ò."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Build S3 API compatibility testing tool named "s3tester"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: QA engineers, DevOps engineers, developers
   ‚Üí Actions: test S3 API operations, validate results, generate reports
   ‚Üí Data: test configurations, credentials, test results
   ‚Üí Constraints: must support various S3 operations and authentication methods
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements clearly specified in reference document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for test execution and validation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable based on specification
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Test configurations, credentials, operations, results
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No unclear aspects, no implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a QA engineer or DevOps professional, I need to verify that S3-compatible storage systems correctly implement the S3 API across various operations and authentication scenarios. I want to define test cases in a configuration file, run them against my S3-compatible service, and receive clear pass/fail results with detailed output to identify any compatibility issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a YAML configuration file with S3 operations and expected results, **When** I run s3tester with the config file, **Then** the tool executes all tests and outputs results showing which operations passed or failed
2. **Given** a test configuration with multiple credential sets, **When** I run tests that require different permission levels, **Then** each test uses the appropriate credentials and validates the expected access control behavior
3. **Given** a configuration with before-test, test, and after-test operations, **When** I execute a test group, **Then** the tool runs setup operations, executes tests, and performs cleanup in the correct sequence
4. **Given** a test that expects a specific S3 error code, **When** the operation fails with that error code, **Then** the test passes and reports the expected failure
5. **Given** the --dry-run flag, **When** I run s3tester, **Then** the tool validates the configuration file without executing any actual S3 operations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when network connectivity fails during test execution?
- How does the system handle malformed YAML configuration files?
- What occurs when credentials are invalid or expired?
- How are file paths handled when using the file:// prefix for object bodies?
- What happens when a before-test operation fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a binary executable named "s3tester"
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept configuration file path via -c or --config command line parameter
- **FR-003**: System MUST parse YAML configuration files with the specified structure (config, credentials, test_cases)
- **FR-004**: System MUST support --dry-run option to validate configuration without executing operations
- **FR-005**: System MUST output test results to stdout in a structured format showing group name, operation, parameters, expected results, and actual results
- **FR-006**: System MUST output errors to stderr when network or other unexpected issues occur
- **FR-007**: System MUST support multiple authentication credentials with different access levels
- **FR-008**: System MUST execute before-test, test, and after-test operations in sequence for each test group
- **FR-009**: System MUST support parallel or sequential test execution based on configuration
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate actual results against expected results (success/failure and error codes)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support file:// prefix for referencing local files in object body parameters
- **FR-012**: System MUST support credential override at individual operation level
- **FR-013**: System MUST support including external configuration files via include directive
- **FR-014**: System MUST support all specified S3 operations including bucket management, object operations, multipart uploads, tagging, lifecycle management, policy management, object lock, CORS, and public access controls
- **FR-015**: System MUST support both virtual-hosted-style and path-style URL formats based on configuration
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle session tokens for temporary credentials
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide clear error messages when operations fail unexpectedly
- **FR-018**: System MUST continue test execution even if individual operations fail (unless it's a before-test failure)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Configuration**: Contains global settings including endpoint URL, region, path style preference, and credential definitions
- **Credential Set**: Named authentication information including access key, secret key, and optional session token
- **Test Group**: Collection of related test operations with shared credentials and setup/teardown procedures
- **Operation**: Individual S3 API call with parameters, optional credential override, and expected result validation
- **Test Result**: Outcome of operation execution including success/failure status, actual vs expected results, and error details
- **Include Directive**: Reference to external configuration files to support modular test organization
